<h2>How This App Came to Be</h2>
<p>
  A investigation was done through interviewing numerouse clients and customers at our 
  local resturant, where customers were complaining about them being unable to get their top
  of the morning breakfast, lunch and dinner due to the exhasting long qeues that the resturant had 
  therefore a group of engineers had to help combat for this issue due to the fact that even they could not 
  get their top of da morning coffee due to the piled up qeues that awaited them. <br>So they needed to find a way 
  to get items delivered as swiftly as possible with the help of technology.
