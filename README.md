<h2>How This App Came to Be</h2>
<p>
  Picture this a fine crispy morning at a top of a day resturant, coffee beans is brewing, honey dripping pancakes, the sweat, sweat 
  luxary sweet just fills the air, however this day could not get any sweeter. Lawyers and businessmen, students of mayhem standing in long qeues leading from Monday,
  to hey, hey its friday, a serpentine line of weary customers winds its way through the establishment, each person longing for their morning fix but growing increasingly frustrated by 
  the wait. Not only was the customers fraustrated but the management team was as well as they were having a hard time keeping track of storck itself.

  It was then that group of engineers seeking problems as opportunities, an astonding idea ignited within their hearts as they also stand in line waiting for their
  top of the morning home brewed cafe, Saw the fraustration of the customers and the stock control team and decided to do something about it.
</p>

<h2>Thought Process of an Engineer...</h2>
<p>
  At this point it wasn't about technology for technologies sake, or getting ride of the resturants extrodinary astablishment, It was about empathy. It was about understanding the pain 
  points of customers and crafting a solution that would not only meet their needs but delight them. The engineers embarked on a journey, diving deep into the daily operations of the 
  restaurant. They spoke to customers, listened to their stories, and absorbed their frustrations and desires. They engaged with the restaurant staff, understanding the challenges they 
  faced during peak hours and how technology could streamline their workflow.
